# Day 1 Notes

## Concepts covered
- print(): output text to the console
- Strings: text wrapped in quotes
- New lines: use \n inside strings
- Concatenation: combine strings with +
- input(): get user input from the console
- Variables: store values for later use
- len(): get the length of a string
- Debugging basics:
  - SyntaxError (e.g., missing quotes, missing brackets)
  - IndentationError (unexpected spaces/tabs)
  - NameError (misspelled variable name)
- Style awareness:
  - basic spacing and readability (PEP 8 principles)
